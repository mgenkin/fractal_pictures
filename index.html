        Clicking adds a new transformation with a fixed point at the clicked point.
        <br/>
        Moving your mouse near an existing fixed point will allow you to edit it by:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Hit DEL to delete the transformation
        <br/>
        'Q' and 'A' increase and decrease the scale factor (initially 1/2)
        <br/>
        'W' and 'S' increase and decrease the rotation (initially 0)
        <br/>
        <br/>
        'E' and 'D' increase and decrease depth: be careful with this, or you will crash your browser.
